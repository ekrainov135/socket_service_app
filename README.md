This is an experimental client-server application project. 
Main goal: interface for simplified interaction with communication channels between devices (possibly of different types). 
Application features:
- remote execution;
- data transfer of different volumes;
- automated synchronization of stored data.

Current status: development of control classes-managers of the server, client side
Next steps:
- add client side functionality;
- optimization of algorithms, refactoring;
- adding exception handling and outputting critical errors to the terminal interface;
- development of file transfer functionality;
- implementation of channels with a secure/encrypted connection;
- development of auxiliary utilities for testing network metrics (data transfer rate, network delay);
- development of new services/protocols and support of old ones.
